            Hi, my name is Samuel Hafner. I am an aspiring web developer equipped with the right mindset to pursue my goals.

        <p>
            For me, programming is more than just a simple means to an end. I love to be challenged and to constantly learn
            new things. There are always new languages and frameworks to master, problems to solve, solutions to find and
            bugs to fix. After all, each new challenge solved will teach me something new in return and make me a better
            programmer.
