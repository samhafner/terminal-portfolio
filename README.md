# Terminal-themed Portfolio by Sam Hafner

This is a different spin on a portfolio website. It does not have a very exciting design, or amazing animations, but it was fun building it. 

See it live [here](https://samhafner.github.io/terminal-portfolio/)

## Inspiration

Since I was just at the beginning of my programming jounrey, I watched a lot of videos to get some inspiration on what I could build. This portfolio was inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYby2QN0kQ) from Forrest Knight.
