# Terminal-themed Portfolio by Sam Hafner

**This is still a work in progress!**

This is a different spin on a portfolio website. It does not have a very exciting design, or amazing animations, but it was fun building it. 

## Tech

- TypeScript
- Vue
- TailwindCSS

## Features

- Responsive Design
- Many commands available (e.g. about me, see a list of my projects, get the current weather)
- Autocomplete feature
- Get previous/next command with arrow keys
- Some fun easer eggs

## Run locally
- Make sure you have node.js and npm installed

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samhafner/terminal-portfolio.git
```

cd terminal-portfolio
```

git remote remove origin
```

npm run preview
```

## Inspiration

Since I was just at the beginning of my programming jounrey, I watched a lot of videos to get some inspiration on what I could build. This portfolio was inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYby2QN0kQ) from Forrest Knight.
